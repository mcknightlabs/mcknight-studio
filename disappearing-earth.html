<h1>Disappearing Earth</h1>

<p>This body of work documents parts of our planet that are rapidly changing, places and species that are disappearing. The snows of Kilimanjaro. The ice caves of Mendenhall Glacier.</p>

<p>My "Disappearing Earth" photos embody how, at the end of the day, we are all just chasing after time. The images were shot on a range of digital cameras – mirrorless, DSLR and fixed lens.</p>

<p>Photos coming soon</p>
