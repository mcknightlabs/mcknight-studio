<h2>Artist Statement</h2>

<p>Scarcity is the central theme of my work.</p>

<p><strong>Scarcity of subject.</strong> I photograph parts of our planet that are rapidly changing, places and species that are disappearing. The snows of Kilimanjaro. The ice caves of Mendenhall Glacier. I also capture images of "the other earth" that most people will never see – the underwater world.</p>

<p><strong>Scarcity of medium.</strong> When I take photos in easily accessible urban locations for my "City Windows" portfolio, I always shoot on the increasingly rare medium of film.</p>

<p><strong>Scarcity of prints.</strong> I only sell limited edition prints.</p>
