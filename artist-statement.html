<h1>Artist Statement</h1>

<p>Scarcity is the central theme of my work.</p>

<p><strong>Scarcity of subject.</strong> I photograph parts of our planet that are rapidly changing, places and species that are disappearing. The snows of Kilimanjaro. The ice caves of Mendenhall Glacier. I also capture rare views of "the other earth" that most people will never see – the underwater world.</p>

<p><strong>Scarcity of medium.</strong> When I take photos in urban areas for my "City Windows" gallery, I always use a scarce, impermanent medium – film.</p>

<p><strong>Scarcity of prints.</strong> I only sell limited edition prints.</p>

<p>Self-mastery is an important part of my identity. To capture these images, I have had to spend many hours over multiple years training as a scuba diver, free diver and mountaineer.</p>
