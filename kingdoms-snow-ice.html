<h1>Kingdoms of Snow and Ice</h1>

<p>This body of work transports the viewer to cold, remote regions of the world like the Himalayas of Nepal.</p>

<p>My "Kingdoms of Snow and Ice" photos embody the great sense of freedom I experience during my treks and alpine mountaineering expeditions. The images were shot on mirrorless digital cameras.</p>

<p>Photos coming soon.</p>
