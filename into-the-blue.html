<h1>Into the Blue</h1>

<p>This body of work surfaces the majesty of "the other earth" that most people will never see â€“ the underwater world. Professional freedivers training in Egypt's Blue Hole. The inside of a school of Black Striped Salemas in the Galapagos.</p>

<p>My "Into the Blue" photos showcase the treasures of the deep and embody the unparalled sense of awe one experiences when traveling beneath the waves. The images were shot on mirrorless digital cameras.</p>

<p>Photos coming soon.</p>
